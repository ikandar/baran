# Baran
A truly content management framework

If you think a framework is to raw for you for creating a web application because it didn't provided database scheme, and a cms is to complex to add some modifications, then Baran is the right tools for you. Baran is a middleware stack between application framework and content management system (cms). Or in another word, Baran is a middleware between Laravel and Wordpress or Symfony and Drupal.

In other word, we build the core of business models, then you handle the view and logic flow. Sound interesting right?

Currently Baran is still works in progess, so stay tuned. If your interest to join this project, just fork and do some pull request.
